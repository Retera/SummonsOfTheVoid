  <li><font face="Arial">Once you have the .zip file, double click it to open the
.zip. It will contain the model (.mdx) and any extra things I included. (Missile
arts, etc)&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"> Take the model out of the .zip and put it on your computer wherever
you want. (It doesn't matter if it's in C:/My Documents or anything else) then
open the warcraft III editor and then the map you want to put the model (or
skin) in.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"> Press the <img border="0" src="../images/Button.gif" width="26" height="23"> button at the top,
you'll be in the Import Manager. Go to File: Import File and select the model
(or skin) on your computer. It's name with the path &quot;war3mapInported\&quot;
before it should appear in the big white box.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"> If the .zip contains a skin file (.blp) as well as the model (if there is one) then do this again importing the
skin instead of the model. After you see the skins name with
&quot;war3mapImported\&quot; double click the skin's name and new path and check
the <img border="0" src="../images/UseCustomPath.gif" width="128" height="21"> box. Then type in the path
that the skin was at in the .zip file.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">After doing this, save the map, or else the model will
    not show up in the editor until you restart the editor.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">To use the model, press the <img border="0" src="../images/OBJEditor.gif" width="25" height="23">
    button and you'll be in the object editor. All the units in the map should
    appear on the left. Click which ever unit you want to use the model, or make
    a new one for it with the <img border="0" src="../images/NewUnit.gif" width="26" height="24"> button.
    Find the row of text that says <img border="0" src="../images/ModFile.gif" width="76" height="15"> and
    double click it. It will bring up a choice:<img border="0" src="../images/Choice.gif" width="826" height="152"></font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Click the bar after the word Import and select the
    model. Click OK. The unit now uses the model.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">If this does not work the model is probably corrupt and
    simply let me know and I could try to fix it. This does not count the
    Villager that wants to be a Zombie in the undead category. That is just
    totally corrupt and can not be fixed.</font></li>

    to see the movie. Voices done by Terri Melinari, a friend of mine.</font></li>
