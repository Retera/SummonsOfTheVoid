<p align="center"><font face="Arial">Well, since I haven't updated in an
exceedingly long time I have a lot to talk about. I had planned a special update
that would add an information page, and a maps page. Unfortunately I discovered
I have no good means of getting maps to be up for download, and no good stuff to
talk about. (and I'm lazy and don't work on my site enough) So I decided to make
a whole new website that was a web comic or movie or such about Warcraft stuff.
It might not get very far, as I'm always doing warcraft things like WoW or
mapmaking and not updating websites, but I'm going to give it a shot.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I made a story in WoW that I sold as 28 <font color="#FFFFFF">[Plain
Letter]</font><font color="#FF6600">s</font> for 7g and the people who bought it
liked it, perhaps my web comic will do just as well. (as if that was linked...)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial">I also don't have that stupid annoying
singing on this page. That was horrible! Just...&nbsp; so... annoying...</font></p>
<p align="center">Tales of Sheepethia...&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't decided what it
is yet, but it can be a start. &quot;Sheepethia&quot; was a warcraft map that I
spent my time making that was horrible, so this will likely be something new. I
should've used my time to make a map as famous as DotA. (Not that it would've
gotten that famous)</p>
<p align="center">Basically, the only thing I'm good for is mapping help, or
model making. Just email me or whisper me on Retera@Azeroth or Shorka on Hyjal
server. These days, I suggest email or WoW mail/whisper. I'm not on Battle.net
much.</p>
